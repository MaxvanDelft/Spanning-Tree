# Computation of the partition matrix

It is possible to generate all spanning trees on the m-lattice, the lattice of height m, by pasting together subgraphs of the lattice. The subgraphs we consider are of width 1 and with vertical edges on one side (left or right). They are called (E-shape or 3-shape) letters. During the proces of generating a spanning tree letters are pasted, bu also the component structure (represented by a non-crossing partition) should be recorded. From the partition it is possible to derive which letters can be added to the partly generated tree. The partition matrix, where the element a_{pq} contains the set of letters that can cause partition transition pq, provides all the information to generate all spanning trees.

In this program the partition matrix is computed through matrix multiplication of so called prime letter matrices. An adjacency matrix corresponding to the graph with nodes (letter, end partition) is derived and for this graph the Parry measure is computed.
